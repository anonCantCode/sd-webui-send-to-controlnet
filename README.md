# sd-webui-send-to-controlnet
Adds buttons to send selected output images to ControlNet #0

## To-do
* ~~Move buttons next to/directly below the default "Send to..." buttons~~
* Support extra ControlNet Units
* Cleanup code

Note that further development is low priority since it already meets my usecase. Hopefully the ControlNet authors/contributers will get around to a better implementation than this hacky one.
