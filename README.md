# sd-webui-send-to-controlnet
Adds four buttons at the bottom of the WebUI to send the current image to ControlNet #0

## To-do
* Move buttons next to/directly below the default "Send to..." buttons
* Support extra ControlNet Units (Too many buttons? Might need a dropdown)

Note that further development is low priority since it already meets my usecase. Hopefully the ControlNet authors/contributers will get around to a better implementation than this hacky one.
